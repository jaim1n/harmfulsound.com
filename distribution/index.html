<h2>Why We're Better Than The Other Guys</h2>

<p>Unlike <i>some</i> platforms <b>(*cough cough* DistroKid *cough cough*)</b>, which charge you for every release or force you to pay every year to keep your music online, Harmful Sound keeps your work up forever. Once your music is live, it stays live — no hidden takedowns, no expiration dates.</p>

<p>At Harmful Sound, you keep more of your royalties. Our goal isn't to take a cut — it's to make sure your music reaches people and stays there.</p>
