<h1>Harmful Sound</h1>

<hr>

<p><b>A global collective uniting artists through music.</b></p>

<p>Harmful Sound brings together artists worldwide - offering label support, publishing, marketing, promotion, and creative collaboration. Members gain access to producers, features with other artists, music videos, cover art design, and more.</p>

<p>Whether you're looking for a place to call home as an up-and-coming artist, a unified group of creatives to collaborate with, from producers to graphic designers and everything in between, or a low-cost, hassle-free alternative to popular distribution services, Harmful Sound has something for everyone. Let's work.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>

<hr>

<p>Harmful Sound provides end-to-end digital music distribution with a focus on accuracy, transparency, and operational efficiency. We handle metadata validation, ISRC/UPC assignment, catalog ingestion, and automated delivery to major DSPs. Our process ensures that releases meet platform compliance standards, update correctly across all services, and remain continuously monitored for performance. Artists and labels benefit from a streamlined release workflow, audit-ready reporting, and a distribution backend designed to support scalability and long-term catalog management.</p>

<h3>Why We're Better Than The Other Guys</h2>

<p>Unlike <i>some</i> platforms <b>(*cough cough* DistroKid)</b> which charge you for every release or force you to pay every year to keep your music online, Harmful Sound keeps your work up forever. Once your music is live, it stays live - no hidden takedowns, no expiration dates.</p>

<p>At Harmful Sound, you keep more of your royalties. Our goal isn't to take a cut - it's to make sure your music reaches people and stays there. Our costs are low, and our team is dedicated to our clients - no more chatbots or waiting 3 to 5 business days for an email back.</p>

<h2>Royalty Management</h2>

<hr>

<p>Harmful Sound specializes in financial administration for music creators, offering precise royalty accounting, automated revenue splits, and fast, reliable payouts. We track income across DSPs, process collaborator percentages, reconcile statements, and generate clear, accounting-friendly earnings reports. Our system supports custom split rules, recoupment tracking, payout scheduling, and detailed historical logs, ensuring every contributor is compensated accurately and on time. The platform is built to deliver professional-grade royalty management for independent artists and small labels seeking enterprise-level financial transparency.</p>
